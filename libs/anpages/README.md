# anpages

If you weren't sick of memory allocation already from [analloc](https://github.com/unixpickle/analloc), here's more! In my OS kernel, all memory allocation will be in terms of fixed-size pages.  These pages follow the Intel standard of 4k bytes per page.  The purpose of anpages is to provide a *really* straightforward linked-list mechanism for allocating and freeing individual pages in memory with minimal overhead.

# Usage

I will add a usage here once I know how *I* want to use this.
